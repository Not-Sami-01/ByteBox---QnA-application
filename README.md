# ByteBox - A simple forum application
#### This is a simple forum application in which a user can ask questions and some other user can reply to the questions
#### This application is designed using raw Php and Ajax. 
### Just use XAMP panel to host it and follow a link like this. http://localhost/Your_Directory/forum 
Its just my practice work which i learned from code with harry and then i modified it and added admin panel and some other features, I also coded a search.php file but that file was accidentally deleted.
